# Sudont

*Because it's actually useful*

Sudont does exactly what it's name says it does. Refuses to run command as root (Because it's Su*DON't* instead of Su*DO*, get it?)

Sudont will still execute the commands you pass into it, just under the invoker's privileges and not root's

## But why?

Yes

## Any practical use?

Sure, troll your co workers with `alias sudo='sudont'`
